        <p>  A corundum is a synthetic gemstone - including synthetic rubies.  Ergo: a tool for synthesizing gems.</p><p>  Corundum starts with the outlook that gemspecs are relatively easy to work with, and that the opinion of the RubyGems team is that they should be treated as a configuration file, not a code file.  Furthermore, Rake is a powerful, easy to use tool, and does admit the use of Ruby code to get the job done.</p><p>  The hard part about publishing gems is getting them into a state you'll be proud of.  There's dozens of fiddly steps to putting together a gem fit for public consumption, and it's very easy to get some of them wrong.</p><p>  Corundum is a collection of Rake tasklibs, therefore, that will perform the entire process of releasing gems, including QA steps up front through generating and publishing documentation.
