GH pages isn't working if remote branch doesn't exist (I think)

Before rake release: run 'bundle install' to make sure that this gem's version is u2d in Gemfile.lock

QA tests:
  XXX, FIXME, profanity filters of code and specs (configurable?)
  Empty filelist
  Check that gem authors are gem owners?
  Gemfile doesn't include :path => or :git => lines?
    (or gem lines at all?)  - needs a lot of configurablity

Twitter press - external user preferences means that API keys can live on
machine, not in repo

Documentation:
  All of: coverage, specs, YARD (or rdoc), showoff, handwritten
  Compiled in one place for publishing
  Biggest trick: compiling an index
