Consider replacing OpenStruct with a configuration object - specifically, restricted fields would help a lot (closer to Struct), as well as a values_at style behavior...

A CommandLine object in place of sh "command line" - mostly this serves a testing purpose, but allows for composition as well

Extract both CommandLine and Tasklib to a GP Rake add-on

QA tests:

XXX, FIXME, profanity filters of code and specs (configurable?)
Empty filelist

Check that gem authors are gem owners?
