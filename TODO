QA tests:
  XXX, FIXME, profanity filters of code and specs (configurable?)
  Empty filelist
  Check that gem authors are gem owners?

Twitter press - external user preferences means that API keys can live on
machine, not in repo

Documentation:
  All of: coverage, specs, YARD (or rdoc), showoff, handwritten
  Compiled in one place for publishing
  Biggest trick: compiling an index
