Bug: generated .rspec uses absolute paths ...

Before rake release: run 'bundle install' to make sure that this gem's version is u2d in Gemfile.lock

Missing something: "don't know how to build docs/Specification"

Documentation assembly is masking rebuilds of docs

QA tests:
  XXX, FIXME, profanity filters of code and specs (configurable?)
  QC filter needs a "allow this many..."
  QC filter: 'default_profanity' so that you don't have to have it in your Rakefile
    (if you care)
  QC filter: ignore_comments (because commented out debugging lines are useful)

  Empty filelist
  gemspec filelist is a subset of VC known files
  Check that gem authors are gem owners?
  Gemfile doesn't include :path => or :git => lines?
    (or gem lines at all?)  - needs a lot of configurablity
  spec files included
  YARD templates missing (?)

Version control QA should come LAST - otherwise there's lots of little dinky commits

Twitter press - external user preferences means that API keys can live on
machine, not in repo

Documentation:
  coverage,
  specs,
  showoff,
  rhet-butler
  handwritten


Missing a case of missing files... don't remember what it was, but I definitely deployed a gem with files missing
Just happened again: lib/corundum/default_configuration/ files missed on release.
  They're not tested, but they're part of the release.
  Maybe add incl/excl lists for QA for files?  So "everything under lib should be in the gem..."

Improve on current simplecov config message:
Try this in /home/judson/ruby/gems/word-bloom/.simplecov
(You can just do ./.bundle/bin/rake > /home/judson/ruby/gems/word-bloom/.simplecov)

tasks for e.g. spec_help/gem_spec_test.rb?

Feature: if the target gem version is pre-release, some QA rules get relaxed?

Feature: QA should check for gem deps in Gemfile - specs aren't valid for QA if so
  - consider building new Gemfile without those gem lines and seeing if specs pass
  - still allows for the case of a gem that passes specs but can't run in the wild

Feature: run specs file-by-file to try to isolate require fails?

Feature: QC tool should list line numbers for iffy words

Feature: documentation coverage as a QA requirement

corundum-skel should generate <project>.gemspec, not gemspec.rb - either last part of PWD or ARGV[0]
corundum-skel should use optparse
corundum-skel should create directories
corundum-skel should have a config file: directories to create, files to template.
Skel'd gemspec should have commented out executables line
