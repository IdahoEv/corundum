Before rake release: run 'bundle install' to make sure that this gem's version is u2d in Gemfile.lock

Missing something: "don't know how to build docs/Specification"

Documentation assembly is masking rebuilds of docs

QA tests:
  XXX, FIXME, profanity filters of code and specs (configurable?)
  p in files
  debugger in files
  Empty filelist
  gemspec filelist is a subset of VC known files
  Check that gem authors are gem owners?
  Gemfile doesn't include :path => or :git => lines?
    (or gem lines at all?)  - needs a lot of configurablity
  spec files included
  YARD templates missing (?)

Twitter press - external user preferences means that API keys can live on
machine, not in repo

Documentation:
  coverage,
  specs,
  showoff,
  handwritten


Missing a case of missing files... don't remember what it was, but I definitely deployed a gem with files missing
Just happened again: lib/corundum/default_configuration/ files missed on release.
  They're not tested, but they're part of the release.
  Maybe add incl/excl lists for QA for files?  So "everything under lib should be in the gem..."


Improve on current simplecov config message:
Try this in /home/judson/ruby/gems/word-bloom/.simplecov
(You can just do ./.bundle/bin/rake > /home/judson/ruby/gems/word-bloom/.simplecov)

tasks for e.g. spec_help/gem_spec_test.rb?
