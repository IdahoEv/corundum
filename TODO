 - solution is to require files in bundler

Output:
  Color QA output, including red/green for review tests
  Output information about file names in a vertical list, rather than [].inspect - c&p fixes

Should CI tasks include all gem QA?

Bug: generated .rspec uses absolute paths ...

Before rake release: run 'bundle install' to make sure that this gem's version is u2d in Gemfile.lock

Missing something: "don't know how to build docs/Specification"

Documentation assembly is masking rebuilds of docs

QA tests:
  QC filter needs a "allow this many..."
  QC filter: ignore_comments (because commented out debugging lines are useful)
  QC filter: should list line numbers for iffy words

  Empty filelist
  gemspec filelist is a subset of VC known files
  Check that gem authors are gem owners?
  Gemfile doesn't include :path => or :git => lines?
    (or gem lines at all?)  - needs a lot of configurablity
  spec files included
  YARD templates missing (?)

Version control QA should come LAST - otherwise there's lots of little dinky commits

Twitter press - external user preferences means that API keys can live on
machine, not in repo

Documentation:
  coverage,
  specs,
  showoff,
  rhet-butler
  handwritten

tasks for e.g. spec_help/gem_spec_test.rb?

Feature: if the target gem version is pre-release, some QA rules get relaxed?

Feature:
  - QA should check for gem deps in Gemfile - specs aren't valid for QA if so
  - consider building new Gemfile without those gem lines and seeing if specs pass
  - still allows for the case of a gem that passes specs but can't run in the wild

? Feature: run specs file-by-file to try to isolate require fails

Feature: documentation coverage as a QA requirement

Use Thor for corundum tool
  corundum-skel -> corundum skel
  ? corundum <anything else> -> Rakefile (Mattock feature...)
corundum-skel should generate <project>.gemspec, not gemspec.rb - either last part of PWD or ARGV[0]
corundum-skel should use optparse
corundum-skel should create directories
corundum-skel should have a config file: directories to create, files to template.
Skel'd gemspec should have commented out executables line
